      <p>I know it looks like I'm a spoiled lil'kit that has the life,<br>
      but it wasn't too long ago that I was living on the streets.<br>
      I've only been living with Jonas for four weeks and I couldn't be happier.<br>
    Just imagine, of all the car engines in the world I could have hidden in, I choose his.<br>
  Oh boy, did he ever LUCK OUT!</p>

      <p>It was totally great to be off the streets, but I did NOT like that sink bath he forced me to take.<br>
      I mean, sure I was covered in fleas and had so much dirt on me that he thought I was grey...<br>
    BUT CATS HATE WATER. I definitely attacked his arms and legs like 15 times as revenge for this when he was least expecting it.</p>

      <p>Now I get fed this stuff called "wet food" that is so dreamy.<br>
        I also have crunchy food out for whenever I want it.<br>
      Ever eaten a shoe? It does NOT taste as good as wet food. No way at all.<br>
    You know I like sleeping, but I also like giving Jonas notes on his homework...<br>
  and then basically like doing it for him when he complains about not having any ideas.<br>
BOY DID HE GET LUCKY!</p>

  <p>I guess you could say I sure know how to pick'em. <br>
    Jonas says he is looking forward to taking me to Vegas <br>
    so I can help him choose numbers in something called Roulette.<br>
  I dunno what that is, but as long as I keep getting wet food, I'm up for anything! </p>
